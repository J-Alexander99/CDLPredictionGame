## CDLPredictionGame
This is a game for fans of the CDL to make predictions on a number of different categories. 

#How does it work?

The process of the game is split up into two parts:
-Making the predictions
-Getting the results

#Making the Predictions
To make the predictions you must first open the CDLGamePredictions.py

From here there are two buttons, the first is the "Get Players" and the second is the "Save Predictions" button. Now we have yet to make our predictions so we need to click on the "Get Players" button first.
This brings us to the next page. Quite self explanatory here we enter the number of players making the predictions. This program can accept any number of players.

After entering the number of players you will be prompted to give names for the players. Do as such. (and dont use any full colons in the name... it will break the code and make me upset..)

From here we find ourselves at the team selections page. This is probably the most complicated part of the application.
We need to add in the teams that we will be predicting for. To do this we need to first go to https://www.breakingpoint.gg/matches and find the match we are predicting for.
Once we find out match take note of the order of the two teams. THIS IS IMPORTANT.

Notice how in this example Miami is on the Left and New York is on the RIght. This is important to remember as this is the order you are going to enter the teams into the program.

Thanks to a recent update the rest of the program can be launched from the file named launcher.py as seen below
