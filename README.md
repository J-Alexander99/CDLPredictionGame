## CDLPredictionGame
This is a game for fans of the CDL to make predictions on a number of different categories. 

#How does it work?

The process of the game is split up into two parts:
-Making the predictions
-Getting the results

#Making the Predictions
To make the predictions you must first open the CDLGamePredictions.py

From here there are two buttons, the first is the "Get Players" and the second is the "Save Predictions" button. Now we have yet to make our predictions so we need to click on the "Get Players" button first.
This brings us to the next page. Quite self explanatory here we enter the number of players making the predictions. This program can accept any number of players.

Thanks to a recent update the rest of the program can be launched from the file named launcher.py as seen below
